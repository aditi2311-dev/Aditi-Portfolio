    <h1><i>Key concepts amd terminology</i></h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>To understand AI, it is essential to be familiar with key concepts and terminology commonly used in the field. This includes understanding different types of AI, such as machine learning and deep learning, as well as the algorithms and techniques used to develop AI systems, e.g., neural networks and reinforcement learning. Other important concepts include natural language processing, computer vision, ethics, and bias in AI</h3>
    <h1><i>Types of AI</i></h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>There are primarily four types of artificial intelligence:

    <ol><li><u>Reactive Machines</u></li>
    These machines can only react to the current situation based on pre-programmed rules without the ability to store past experiences. They are not capable of using historical data to make future decisions. Examples of reactive machines include Deep Blue, which IBM used to beat a world chess champion, and AlphaGo, which Google developed to defeat human Go champions.
        
    <li><u>Limited Memory</u></li>
    Limited memory AI systems can store past experiences and use them to make informeddecisions in the future. These systems can analyze and interpret historical data to improve their performance. Examples of limited memory AI include self-driving cars, which use data from sensors and cameras to make driving decisions.

    <li><u>Theory of Mind</u></li>
    This type of AI can understand human emotions, beliefs, intentions, and desires. It can interact with humans in a way that is similar to how humans interact with each other. Theory of Mind AI is still in its early stages of development, and no commercial applications exist yet.
        
    <li><u>Self-aware AI</u></li>
    This is the most advanced type of AI that can understand its existence and capabilities and reason about its thoughts and actions. Self-aware AI does not exist, but some researchers speculate it could be developed.

    The different types of AI are categorized based on their level of complexity and sophistication. As technology advances, we may see new categories emerge, and existing categories may become more refined.</h3></ol>
